# üöÄ Overview

### 1. Quick Links
Customize your top navigation bar with shortcuts to any GitHub pages you frequently visit. Whether it's your team's project board, your organization's repositories, or your favorite discussion forums - keep them all just one click away.

### 2. Custom Query Feeds (Dashboards)
Harness the power of GitHub's search syntax to create personalized notification feeds.

#### Example Queries:
- üì¨ Stay on top of notifications with `notifications is:unread`
- üëÄ Monitor incoming review requests with `is:pr requested-review:<your-username>`
- ‚úÖ Track issues assigned to you with `is:issue assignee:<your-username>`
- üìä Follow specific repository activity with `repo:<owner>/<repo> is:open`
- üë• Watch team mentions with `team:<org>/<team-name>`

## üîî Badge Notifications

Each dashboard can be configured to show badge notifications, allowing you to monitor the count of items matching your queries right from your browser.

- üîÑ See how many pull requests need your review
- üì± Track the number of unread notifications  
- üìã Monitor the count of open issues assigned to you

These badge notifications update automatically, ensuring you never miss important updates without having to constantly check GitHub.
